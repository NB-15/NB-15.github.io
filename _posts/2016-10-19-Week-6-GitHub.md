    <td>I learned by getting my head down and working and listening to Mr Keen's tips when available. Nothing was really clicking into place, but then suddenly, towards the end of the lesson, I had the lightbulb moment that I needed and everything clicked into place. I had already seen some of the formulae used previous to the lesson, but a quick refresher of the memory was all I needed and I began to make some somewhat decent progress, in a OK structure. After some point about halfway through the lesson, my brain packed up for an early half term holiday and I started getting stuck.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As with previous weeks, my peers decided that their work still took priority even when they were done and refused to give me much guidance or tips (of use, anyway). This should have been a relatively easily task, but inevitably I started lagging behind so working faster is definitely a habit to work on. Another factor limiting my learning is my sheer incompetence with a computer compared to those around me, and the latter is something I will not magically be able to change for next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again, just generally being better at IT will not just suddenly happen for next lesson, but taking notes on what Mr Keen is saying at the start on my iPad may help me remember key points and not land me in as deep problems with GitHub etc. as before.</td>
