  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by Going into IT4 and learning layout strategies from Alex and Theo and FaceTime'ing Theo to make sure I was on the right track. This lesson didn’t happen due to an Enrichment day so this work had to be done either at home or at school on different days. I also learnt by doing my own research and using it to edit my code and layout slightly. Currently my website IS better than when I started out at the start of the last lesson, but I have not completely achieved my task. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that I didn’t have lesson time where I could ask for help at any given time. Instead it became necessary for me to be more self-sufficient, which proved difficult due to my very limited skills in this project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I can’t really change anything for next time because this was a one-off lesson where I didn’t have access to the full amount of resources available. If this happened again (i.e. we didn’t have a lesson for some reason) then all I would do to improve is ask Mr Keen to make sure I am firmly on track rather than risk a faulty website that has not got all the right components.</td>
