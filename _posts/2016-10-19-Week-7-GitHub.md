    <td>Today was mostly spent marvelling at Mr Keen's seemingly impossible, intimidating spreadsheet on Google Sheets, which we were tasked to replicate and use some of its formula, which was new today. While the more able at Computing among us swiftly got underway with learning this foreign language (ie spreadsheet formulae), I, as usual, started slowly and inevitably got stuck. However, for a change, I did ask others for some tips and actually got some, so I could progress. Also, some others were actually in the same boat as me, the "S.S Stuck", and we collaborated together to try and make some sense of the task. It almost worked, as we actually started to brainstorm a few possible ideas, but it turned out that they were still the wrong ones.</td>

    <td>Remember, this lesson was nowhere close to being a GitHub lesson, so learning today was somewhat limited by the lack of resources such as W3Schools to look at when slightly confused. In fact, my only resources for this task are probably my peers, Mr Keen or my dad, who luckily is an expert at spreadsheets having done them in a previous job. For homework, I should be able to finish this, or at least give it a very good shot. I also have the a small chunk of the Half Term break to try and sort this out, and again speed is a major factor limiting my learning because I always have a fair chunk of work to do at home along with these weekly blog posts. </td>

    <td>The success of next time, (If there is one, since this may have been our last lesson) will need to change dramatically if I am to get this GitHub and Spreadsheet lark back on track. Building up my knowledge of the upcoming lesson (ie practise formulae) may help keep up with what we are doing in the lesson and will allow me to work off my own bat. Knowing what to expect will be pivotal in keeping up with the lesson. Of course this doesnâ€™t apply if we are starting something completely unforeseen and new like last week, but I can make a pretty well-educated guess about what we would do next lesson (If it is still spreadsheets). Avoiding distractions like this week may also be useful- but then again talking to others may be valuable in understanding and completing the task.</td>
