  <tr>
    <td>Asking for help when stuck helped a lot, and Alex and Theo helped me understand. After hitting a brick wall in Lesson 1, everything came together and i even personalised my website so it looked presentable. I am now developing a solid understanding of Github and i can make good progress and move on to the more advanced stages in the development of this website. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My very limited understanding of the task prevented me from quick progression in the first part of the lesson, and I need to work on not being afraid to ask for help to understand the problem and therefore ultimately make progress. My learning was also limited by a mouthguard appointment during the lesson which reduced the amount of time i had, but i was keen to finish and stayed in at lunch to make sure i was up to date.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will come to the lesson with a wide understanding of the task set for the lesson, and work efficiently and to a very high standard. I could improve my learning by focusing on the task and thoroughly think through all of the steps needed to reach the end goal.  </td>
