    <td>I learned by figuring problems out myself, and using my initiative to solve some incorrect pieces of code. Despite me solving most of the website's issues like background colour matching, some problems still exist, but they can be solved in the lesson when there are others for guidance. An effective strategy was searching online for guidance and so W3Schools was very helpful.</td>

    <td>My learning was limited by distractions all around me and Theo showing off his website. (Sigh….Much appreciated, by the way….not) He was up on his high horse as usual and once again he refused to share his strategies just so he could have the feeling that he had knowledge that others, including me, didn’t. I need to work on utilising all available resources such as the internet itself. Believe it or not this is actually the first week where i properly made use of the internet.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Theo’s snide comments and distractions will be hard to deal with again, as it is his personal mission to make sure no one has a good website like him. I will have to improve my learning  by moving away or something. Utilising W3Schools again will be a good resource and will improve my learning. Actually, just the internet in general has lots of tips and information and is a great refuge from the evil Theo’s distractions, as he is hell-bent on showing off and boasting about his "masterful" website</td>
