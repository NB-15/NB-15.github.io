    <td>Another week of half term, another slab of work to do. Again on Sheets, with the tasks of finding the formula errors and just finishing off the last little bits. This weeks' learning has been very independent, as I could figure out everything that needs fixing, and the most effective strategy was no more than getting my head down and working. This was probably the easiest time on Sheets yet as I had already figured out most of the hard components. All that was required was a little bit of guidance from Dad and I was away and running.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The only thing that majorly limited my learning was not me for once, but the tool that I was working on. Unfortunately the (ancient) computer that I do my work on at home has a tendency to lag, crash, run out of battery or anything else. It only just manages to run Windows 7, and as a result made trying to edit a spreadsheet very unpleasant. It wouldn't surprise me if it went blue screen soon, but it just about managed to cope with my large spreadsheet. However, I wasn't impeccable at sorting the problems out and so unsurprisingly some things still went wrong with my edits. Perseverance is probably the most standout habit to work on, as unfortunately figuring some particularly troublesome snippets of formulae out took - inevitably- quite a while to sort out.</td>

    <td>Something to change for next time would definitely be the computer I use- which luckily I can since I can go back to school and use the more responsive iMacs there. Also, making my varying quantities more formula based would help- so I can change one thing and EVERYTHING else would change with it. My frustration at how long it took to get the formula right deterred me from making much more of it elsewhere. However, plenty of it was made, and it was successful too- and improving learning would just be making sure all of my formula is successful and shows high levels of understanding.
