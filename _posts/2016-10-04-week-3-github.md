  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by asking others how they had laid out theirs because they were achieving good presentation while my website was at the stage where people were on the verge of vomiting. I did make some improvement, however, for example changing my background to a less sickening gif. Some effective strategies included visiting the W3Schools website for HTML help in improving the layout.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by distractions from all around me and a need to be able to get work done quick enough. Also @Tedsome03.github.io was making great progress and had an amazing website but refused to share his strategies and ideas with me. Compared to it, my website is currently atrocious.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning for next time by coming to see Mr keen or Alex for help in improving the layout. And since Mr Keen will be looking at my website sometime soon, it would be wise to ask him for criteria on what he is looking for.</td>
