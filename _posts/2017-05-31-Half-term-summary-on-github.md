    <td>Collaboration was important in learning today, but as we all had our own quizzes to make, it was important to settle down after brief discussion of how to effectively structure code and fix any errors thrown. There was no need to consult the internet today, due to our already sizeable understanding of the task set. Computational thinking and looking for patterns became helpful today, as the code was mostly a fixed algorithm where the main structure needed little changing. Attention to detail was paramount, because as ever there were some obscure issues to iron out, often small but usually quiz-breaking as repl.it threw up lots of errors and structural errors. This became quite a simple task as I got the hang of it, but I couldn't simply sit back and coast through.</td>

    <td>The limiting factors for optimum learning today were time constraints and distractions from my peers, who were excitedly showing off their finished quizzes and getting people to play them. In this case I needed to work on shutting out background noise and distractions, despite noise and other distractions coming at me from every direction. Also worth working on would be maybe practising skills that we would need for the upcoming lesson and revising the content through codecademy. This would allow me to come to the lesson prepared so I could immediately get down to successful work, and ask Mr Keen good questions to check and consolidate my learning out of school.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Improving my learning could be achieved through working through online resources out of school to be at an advantage in the lesson. Even more effective collaboration could be achieved and making sharing information amongst others even more valuable to our learning. Coming to the lesson with even better preparation for the task makes understanding the objective easier. Also, next lesson I will try and sit in an isolated, secluded spot to minimise distractions and distracting others. The only issue with this is lots of stick from peers for being a loner with no friends, however I will have to ignore it if it helps concentrate on my learning. This step is quite flawed and drastic but could benefit my learning if I'm lucky.</td>
